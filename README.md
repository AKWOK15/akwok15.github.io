# Colby Club Hockey Website
# About The Project
As a prospective college student, I could not find a way to contact Colby club hockey to express my interest and to learn more about the club. As a result, I learned JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build this website which consolidates all information relevant to club hockey: announcements, roster, schedule, and a contact form. I strive to always improve this website and as I learn more tools (learning React right now), I will be able to build more features with those tools.
